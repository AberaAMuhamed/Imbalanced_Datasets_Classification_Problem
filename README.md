## Predicting Service Payment Calls: Addressing Imbalanced Data for Improved Model Performance  

This project tackles the challenge of predicting customers likely to make a service payment call within the next 5 days for XYZ organization. This information will be used to trigger proactive emails, encouraging customers towards online payment options and increasing efficiency.

**Challenges of Imbalanced Data**

The dataset likely exhibits imbalanced class distribution, where the number of customers making calls is significantly lower than those who don't. This imbalance can significantly impact traditional machine learning algorithms. These algorithms prioritize minimizing overall error, leading them to favor the majority class and potentially misclassify the minority class (callers) entirely.

**Addressing Imbalance**

This project explores various techniques to address the imbalanced data challenge and improve model performance:

**1. Data-Level Techniques:**

* **Oversampling:** Increase the representation of the minority class by:
    * **Random Oversampling:** Duplicating existing minority class instances. 
    * **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)::** Creating synthetic data points for the minority class.
* **Undersampling:** Reduce the representation of the majority class to achieve a more balanced distribution.

**2. Algorithm-Level Techniques:**

* **Class Weighting:** Assigning higher weights to the minority class during training, forcing the model to pay greater attention to these instances.
* **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Imposing a higher penalty for misclassifying minority class instances, encouraging the model to prioritize accurate predictions for them.

**3. Ensemble Methods:**

* **Bagging and Boosting:** Combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data to improve overall robustness. 
* **SMOTEBoost:** A specialized technique that combines SMOTE with boosting for enhanced performance on imbalanced datasets.

**Evaluation Metrics**

Traditional accuracy metrics are not suitable for imbalanced datasets. This project will utilize more appropriate metrics like:

* **Precision:** Measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct (callers identified correctly).
* **Recall:** Measures the proportion of actual call-making customers that are correctly predicted.
* **F1-Score:** Combines precision and recall into a single metric.
* **ROC Curve:** Visualizes the trade-off between accurately identifying true callers and incorrectly identifying non-callers.
* **AUC-ROC:** Area Under the ROC Curve, quantifies the model's overall ability to distinguish callers from non-callers.

By carefully selecting and applying these techniques, this project aims to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for predicting service payment calls, ultimately improving the efficiency of XYZ's payment process.
